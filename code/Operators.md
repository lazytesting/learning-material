# Operators

## What are operators
A symbol which executes a specific action.

Example: 
```1 + 2 = 3```
the '+' signs says you to add the number before it (1) and sum it with the number after it (2)
the '=' sign tells you to execute the calculation

## Which kind of operators are there

### Arithmetic Operators
Used to do math
By example the + or the -.

### Relational Operators
To compare two variables
By example: < (smaller) or == (equal to)

### Bitwise Operators
Just skip this for now

### Logical Operators
Making logical comparisons which result in a boolean
By example: && is the AND compare. 

### Assignment Operators
Assign a specific value to a variable
By example: = (assign value) or += (add value to current value)

### Misc Operators
skip for now

## Good to know
Operators are executed in a specifc order, just like you do in math.

## Assignment
A few small task to complete in code:
- add 'a' and 'b' and assign it to 'c'
- 'c' is true if 'a' is true or 'b' is true
- 'c' is false if 'a' is false and 'b' is false
- 'a' is 1. 'b' is 3. add 'b' to 'a'
- 'a' is 12 increment it by 1
- 'c' is true if 'a' is bigger or equal to 'b'
