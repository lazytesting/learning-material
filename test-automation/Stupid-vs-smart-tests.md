--------------

1. Reasons to make tests smart
------------------------------

-   can be more robust

-   less code needed to add tests

-   better re-usable

 

2. Why smartass tests are annoying
----------------------------------

-   it adds complexity

-   can lead to different execution paths

-   how to test your tests?

3. How to measure
-----------------

-   A good measure is cyclomatic complexity =\> how much decisions

-   Do you need tests on your tests?

 

4. Best approach
----------------

-   in general the test should be stupid

-   when you need to a specific functionality with a lot of data you can
    introduce a bit of intelligence
